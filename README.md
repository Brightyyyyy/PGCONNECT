PGCONNECT is a platform developed to streamline and simplify the process of finding suitable accommodations, specifically paying guest (PG) facilities and hostels. It is designed to serve both local and non-local students and working professionals by offering a location-based directory of available accommodations. Each listing on the platform includes key details such as pricing, contact information of the owner, available amenities, and images of the property. A standout feature of PGCONNECT is its secure and transparent review system, which only allows current residents of a PG or hostel to submit ratings and feedbackâ€”ensuring reviews are authentic and trustworthy. Additionally, the platform incorporates a robust filtering system that enables users to efficiently narrow their search based on specific criteria like price range, room sharing options, availability of air conditioning, and other preferences. By combining detailed listings with genuine reviews and customizable search options, PGCONNECT provides a convenient and reliable solution for anyone looking to find PG accommodations or hostels that best meet their needs.
